# Project Title: Text Reranking Based on LLMs

### About the Project

Our project, "Text Reranking Based on LLMs," focuses on enhancing the accuracy and relevance of search results using advanced Large Language Models (LLMs). By leveraging descriptions from Kaggle datasets and the Ask Ubuntu questions dataset, our goal is to refine search outcomes, ensuring users quickly find the most pertinent information. This project addresses the need for efficient data and question ranking, which improves user experience, optimizes resources, aids learning and decision-making, and fosters community engagement.

To achieve these objectives, we utilized models such as SFR-Embedding-2_R and Qwen2-7B-instruct. The SFR-Embedding-2_R model is designed for generating high-quality embeddings that capture the semantic context of the text, making it highly effective for tasks requiring precise text similarity assessments. Qwen2-7B-instruct, on the other hand, is a powerful LLM tailored for instruction-following tasks, offering robust performance in understanding and generating human-like responses to complex queries.

The evaluation of these models will be based on their embedding capabilities, as benchmarked by Hugging Face's MTEB leaderboard. Through this comprehensive approach, we aim to provide a robust solution for text reranking, significantly benefiting platforms that require precise and relevant search functionalities.
